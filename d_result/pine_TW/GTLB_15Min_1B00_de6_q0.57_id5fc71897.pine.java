// EXPLANATION OF THE STRATEGY
//The provided Pine Script implements a trading strategy that includes stop loss (SL) and multiple take profit (TP) levels,
//with an option to activate a trailing stop at the third TP level. Here's a detailed breakdown of its components and functionality:

//Variables Initialization:
var float stop = na
var float limit1 = na
var float limit2 = na

// Converts a percentage to points based on the average position price and the minimum tick size.
percent2points(percent) =>
    strategy.position_avg_price * percent / 100 / syminfo.mintick

// Stop Loss and Take Profit Inputs:
//Defines inputs for stop loss and three take profit levels in percentage terms.

log.info("Stop Loss (sl):", sl," Take Profit 1 (tp1):", tp1, " Take Profit 2 (tp2):", tp2," Take Profit 3 (tp3):", tp3)

//Calculates the current profit in points based on the position size and price.

// Stop Loss and Profit Target Price Calculations:
//Determines the stop loss and profit target prices based on the position size and offset points.

//SIGNAL MANAGE    User Adjustments and Risk Management
// The user can adjust the threshold values for op_operation to control the level of risk they are willing to take:
// Lower op_operation Threshold for Buy Signal (e.g., 0.5 instead of 0.55):
//     Effect: Generates more buy signals, increasing the frequency of trades. This is suitable for a user willing to take more risks and potentially capture more trading opportunities.
// Higher op_operation Threshold for Buy Signal (e.g., 0.8 instead of 0.55):
//     Effect: Generates fewer buy signals, reducing the frequency of trades. This is suitable for a user seeking to take fewer risks and only enter trades under more favorable conditions.
// Lower op_operation Threshold for Signal Closure (e.g., -0.8 instead of -0.9):
//     Effect: Closes positions less frequently, allowing trades more room to recover from temporary unfavorable conditions. This increases risk but can capture larger gains if the market reverses favorably.
// Higher op_operation Threshold for Signal Closure (e.g., -0.95 instead of -0.9):
//     Effect: Closes positions more frequently, exiting trades quickly at the first sign of unfavorable conditions. This decreases risk but may result in missed opportunities for recovery.
//Signal BUY

// Impact on the Dataset
//Stop Loss (SL): Limits the maximum loss by exiting the position if the price moves against the trade by a specified percentage.
//Take Profit (TP1, TP2, TP3): Defines profit-taking levels to secure gains at different stages.
//Trailing Stop: Optionally activates a trailing stop at the third TP level to lock in profits while allowing for further gains if the price continues to move favorably.
//Position Entry and Exit: The strategy's buy and sell signals determine when to enter and exit positions, influencing the dataset by marking the points of trade execution and closure.
//Current Stage Tracking: Monitors the trade's progress through predefined stages, adjusting stop and profit levels accordingly.
//This strategy is designed to manage risk and maximize profits through a structured approach, incorporating multiple exit levels and dynamic adjustments based on market conditions. The dataset will reflect these actions, showing entries, exits, stop loss activations, and profit-taking events, providing valuable information for backtesting and performance analysis.
//Random forest AI offers significant advantages in trading, including the ability to handle large data sets, reduce overfitting and provide more robust predictions through the aggregation of multiple decision trees.
