"""Turn the strategy factory's output into the shop's catalogue.

The factory is the twin repository that generates the data, Leci37/ML-Sklearn-strategy-stock-crypto-for-TraderView:
its step 7 (S_04_ladding_file_info_to_see_in_web.py) writes the export, d_result/ and a package of both,
d_result/package/.

    python catalogue/publish.py --package DIR [--prune]
    python catalogue/publish.py EXPORT.csv [--assets DIR] [--prune]

catalogue/contract.json is the contract between the two repositories: the catalogue's columns, which
factory folder holds each file a row names, which static/assets/ folder it goes to and how each full
script is named. Both forms check the columns against it: a missing column, or one the contract does
not know, stops the publish before anything is written (drift between the twins must be loud).

--package DIR  the factory's package: catalogue.csv, the charts, icons and previews its rows name, and
               manifest.json with the sha256 of every file and of every full script (which stay out of
               the package). The whole package is checked first (read_package): its contract is this
               one, every file is listed with the right sha256 and nothing else is there, every file a
               row names is in it or already in static/assets/, and the private list names the script
               of every row. Then exactly what was checked is published as below (each file's bytes are
               checked again as they are copied: the factory may be writing d_result/ meanwhile),
               replacing the charts and previews that changed and the factory's placeholder logos the
               shop still shows (any other logo the shop has is kept, and said), and
               catalogue/release.json records which factory run the shop shows.
EXPORT.csv     the tab-separated export (pine_TW_img_info_*_WEB.csv), the form before packages;
--assets DIR   then copies the files the catalogue uses from DIR (the factory's d_result/) into
               static/assets/, leaving the ones already there as they are. An export has no manifest:
               a release.json of an earlier package is deleted, since it no longer says what is shown.
--prune        deletes files in static/assets/{charts,previews} that no catalogue row uses.

Publishing:
  - keeps one row per strategy (ticker, interval, key_techs, id_model): the export repeats some;
  - rewrites every image and preview path to a relative assets/... path (under static/), whether the
    export gave a local path or an absolute raw.githubusercontent.com URL;
  - drops pine_path, the location of the full paid script, which must never be public;
  - names a ticker the export calls by its exchange code (BINANCE:XRPUSD) as "XRP / US Dollar",
    or by the name another row of the same ticker has;
  - keeps the shop's own optional columns (version) from the current catalogue.csv when the
    export does not bring them, so a re-publish does not reset every strategy to v1;
  - writes catalogue/catalogue.csv, the one file both the page and the server read
    (the server takes prices from it, never from the browser).
Every file is first written beside its destination and all are renamed into place only when every one
was written (Staged): a failure half way (a full disk, a package that changed) leaves the shop as it was.
The paid scripts are not handled here: they go to the private storage (STRATEGIES_DIR, by default
<ZLECITOOL_DATA_DIR>/edgefolio/strategies); `flask --app app edgefolio import DIR` does both.

Every preview is cut as the factory cuts the paid ones (the script up to 50 lines into its first
tree, then a note): the factory's previews of the free strategies were the whole script, which
made the free download's email step pointless.

ROOT, ASSETS and OUT are module attributes, and every function takes out=/assets= too, so tests (here
and in the factory) point them at temporary folders; release.json always goes beside OUT.
